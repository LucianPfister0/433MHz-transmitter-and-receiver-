You will need to download and set up the Radiohead library but the video goes through that. <br />
Working circuit - https://youtube.com/shorts/FVw99CiTiyU?feature=share <br />
The current circuit uses two buttons to send a packet through the transmitter to the receiver one of the buttons sends a 1 the other sends a 2 this can be increased to however many buttons are needed. The received signal is seen in the serial monitor. The code can then be used for whatever purpose you are trying to use it for with the received data from the packets.
